A modified version of MATLAB packages for the original version of the ice layer annotation technique that was published in "Xiong S, Muller JP, Carretero RC. A new method for automatically tracing englacial layers from MCoRDS data in NW Greenland. Remote Sensing. 2017 Dec 27;10(1):43."
Several modifications include the following main aspects:
- Peak detection strategy
- Seed points selection using image processing techniques
- New validation metrics
